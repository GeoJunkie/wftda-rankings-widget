# WFTDA Rankings Widget

Add a widget to your site with the WFTDA stats from stats.wftda.com.

Currently, the widget will scrape the data from http://stats.wftda.com/team/{team}. Once the WFTDA makes an API available, it will use that API.

## Getting the plugin

The most current released version is [available on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wftda-rankings-widget/). You can also install it directly from your WordPress dashboard.

It can also be downloaded [directly from this repository](https://github.com/GeoJunkie/league-wftda-ranking/releases/latest).

## Contributing

I'm currently working to update the build process, which will also make this more available to contributors. This section will be updated once that process is complete.
